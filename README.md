# CardGame

This is a Game created for the Final project of my APCS class in 2018-2019.
It is the card game UNO, with 4 players (over local wifi).

The project is split into two programs. One server program must be run to host a game,
and four client programs must be run on the same network to connect to the session. 

Once every client is connected, the game begins, and players use the in-game GUI to select/play 
cards and view the state of other players' hands.
